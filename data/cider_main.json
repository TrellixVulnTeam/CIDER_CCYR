Michael arranged for me to work at his uncle's institution.    A: How much will you be paid?    B: Judy, I don't do it for money, but for experience. Besides, it's voluntary work.    A: You work without payment? That's really something.    B: When will you leave for home?    A: Tomorrow. We'll fly to Hawaii two days after. I really have to pack now.    B: Go then.

How much is it?    A: It's seventy dollars plus tax.    B: It's a little expensive. Do you think it's possible to get a discount?    A: Hmm, since you like it so much, how about a 10 percent discount. That's the best I can offer.    B: That's good. Could you wrap it up for me?    A: Sure.

They say that arm exercises can make you physically healthy.    B: But I was told that arm exercises could raise your blood pressure.    A: Yes, but the article I read suggests some ways to make up for that.    B: Really? How?    A: By adding leg exercises, so that the arms don't do all the work.    B: And in return, I'm sure that there's a good chance of losing weight.    A: Sounds right to me.    B: So what exercises do the experts suggest?    A: They mentioned quite a few exercises, but one of the most popular ones is cycling.    B: Good, I must try that. ",

Get her to come back for a while to help?    B: I don't suppose she come. She never got on with her father. He is bit of a tough character and she is rather selfish.

A: That bad-tempered old thing?    B: Oh, he isn't really bad-tempered. He just looks it. He is an excellent doctor, taught me a lot, and he has a very nice family. His wife invites me over there to supper every week. Very pleasant.    A: Yes. I teach their daughter Pen at school.

A: How did you do it?    B: Do you know this diet that many actors are doing? I don't think it's very healthy if you do it for a long time, but it really works.    A: I think meat is not allowed in your diet.    B: No, actually, you can eat things like, um, roast chicken, steak, and bacon, but you can't eat any bread and butter.    A: Is it the diet that you love but have to avoid?    B: That's right. Dieting is so boring. Hopefully, I won't need to wear the wedding dress again anyway. ",

You could set it ahead of the exact time so that you could have got up earlier and not have been late.    B: I did that, but it seemed useless when I found the batteries had run out after I woke up this morning. I rushed to school and luckily, my neighbour Mr. Green gave me a hand and took me to school with his car.    A: So you could have made it. But you were still late for class.    B: The thing is, when I got off, I found I had left my bag in his car. And it was too late to get it back when I realized that. I went straight to the nearest shop and gave him a call. I waited for five minutes before Mr. Green drove back.    A: Finally, he gave you your bag and you came to the classroom and you were already 15 minutes late for class at that time. Is that all?

A: Excuse me, if I'm not wrong, you've only twenty now. Is it too old at twenty?    B: Yes, too old for a swimmer. If I swim in an international competition, I'll hardly be able to win.    A: But...er...don't you enjoy swimming?    B: Certainly, and I enjoy visiting other countries, and the Olympics are very exciting. However, I missed more important things. I had to work very hard at swimming. There was training before school, after school, and at weekends. While other girls were growing up, I was swimming, swimming.

Do you mind saying something about your divorce?    B: No. I got divorced years ago. Even worse, I got divorced when I had small children.    A: Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives.    B: Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children.    A: How?    B: We tell them we love them and will always do.    A: You haven't thought of saving the marriage?    B: Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer.    A: Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it.    B: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing.    A: Yet most people believe a had marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think?    B: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarrelling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children.    A: What do you want society to do for you?    B: Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future. ",

What happened?    A: A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill!    B: That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive?    A: No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly.    B: What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure?    A: Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers.    B: Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language?    A: Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction.    B: How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident?    A: The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet.    B: So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.    A: Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.    B: Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other. ",

B: Well, I don't care if I share with other people, but I'm not good at housework. Maybe a home stay would be OK, but I don't like young children, because they're noisy and it's difficult to study. Hopefully, I can live with a lady who has retired.    A: OK, that's no problem. But I must warn you that living with a family in London is very expensive. Much more expensive than other small cities.    B: That's not a big problem. I have some money saved. Besides, I can always get a part-time job. I'm working in a supermarket as a cashier now. So I don't think I will have trouble with money.    A: Sounds good. I'll call you if I get some information about that.    B: OK, that's great. Thank you very much.    A: You are welcome. ",

Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here?    B: Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains.    A: Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice?    B: Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance.    A: But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States?    B: Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life.    A: I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding. ",

B: Well, let's see. Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time.    A: Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music?    B: That seems to be the case.    A: That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell?    B: Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports.

Have you been leaving it in as I told you?    B: Well, it hurts so much, doctor, especially when I eat.    A: I understand, Mrs. Jackson. It hurts in the beginning, I know. But it's really better to leave it in, except when you clean it of course.    B: Well, I did at first, doctor, but it hurt so much that I just couldn't stand it any longer.    A: Well, maybe we can set it a little more.    B: Set it right?    A: Yes. When can you come here?    B: Oh, right away, doctor, if you don't mind.    A: Let me see, can you get here by 11:00?

I haven't visited you since I called about my will. You helped me with that, you remember?    A: Yes, I remember. Do you want to make any changes in your will?    B: I don't think that will be necessary, but you'll tell me if it is. I left everything, you remember, to my wife, and, after her death, to my son Jerry. I've about $ 15 000 in shares of industrial companies. These bring in, after paying tax, about $ 1 125 a year. Well, I'm earning a good salary now, and I shall get a good pension from my employers, so my wife and I can live fairly comfortably with this extra income. I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him.    A: Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house.    B: Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect.    A: Have you found a plot yet?    B: Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me.    A: I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land. You're not allowed to build a house without permission from the Planning Authority. And sometimes the Authority decides that a house must be built of stone, and not of brick, so that it doesn't spoil the surrounding village. ",

No, I haven't been out much recently. I've been feeling a bit under the weather.    A: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't mind me saying, but you don't look very well. Your face is very pale. Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today.    B: That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket.    A: You look as if you've lost weight as well.    B: I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me.    A: Have you been to the doctor? What did she say?    B: I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious.    A: You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

A: How many people will be taking part this year?    B: This is our biggest year ever. We have twelve hundred cyclists registered.    A: I doubt they'll block the road when the cyclists start out?

And most people rent a motor bike because you can get around faster and even go to the beach if you like.    B: If I wanted to hire 2 motor bikes tomorrow morning for 2 days, would there be any problem?    A: No problem at all. May I know your name?    B: It's Green, G-R-E-E-N.    A: And your telephone number?    B: I'm at the Holiday Sun Hotel. My number is 0708112, I'm in Room 1203. By the way, is your bike rental shop at No.100 Teckman Street?    A: That's right.

You know, it's the boating that I don't like.    A: Well, what are you up to?    B: Sit on my sofa all weekend and watch the DVDs I've just bought. And that will be a busy weekend.

A: According to the forecast, it'll be cloudy the day after tomorrow, good for a ride.    B: Great! Do you go riding often?    A: Absolutely. I go as much as I can, because we can really get in touch with nature. It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want any company?    B: Sure, but it will be a 30-mile ride. Have you been riding so long before?    A: Yeah, I go a lot too. I even saw a bear and some monkeys on my last ride. My friend Mike and I rode more than 30 miles to a very wild part of the national forest.    B: Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city. Shall we invite him to go along?    A: Of course. I'll ask him.    B: Thanks. We will have a good time this weekend. ",

A: It has lovely views, and one of the most beautiful bridges in the world - the Golden Gate Bridge. It's a very hilly city. The hills are in the middle of the town, so you have to walk up and down hills when you go anywhere. When you arrive, your car needs good brakes.    B: Do you have to drive? Can't you take buses?    A: Well, most people who visit San Francisco ride in the cable cars. A cable car goes on tracks, and a strong cable pulls it up the hills.    B: That doesn't sound very safe.    A: Don't worry. Hundreds of people ride in cable cars every day. ",

I wondered if you could do some catering for us next week, we are having a small reception. It's to launch our summer holiday advertising campaign. Will you be free?    A: When exactly is it? Mr. Smith?    B: April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday.    A: Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it?    B: We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there.    A: Ok. What sort of things would you like?    B: Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again.    A: Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for?    B: Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure.    A: Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week.    B: Ok. ",

She's in my Shakespearean English class. Has anything happened to her?    B: Nothing, it's just that she submitted a job application yesterday and the company asked her in for an interview today. She's afraid she won't be able to attend your class this afternoon. I'm calling to see whether it would be OK if I gave you her essay.    A: Certainly, that would be fine. Uh, you can either drop it off at my class or bring it to my office.    B: Would it be all right to come by your office around 4:00? I'm afraid I can't come any earlier because I have three classes this afternoon.    A: Uh, I won't be here when you come. I'm supposed to be at a meeting from 3:00 to 6:00, but how about leaving it with my secretary? She usually stays until 5:00.    B: Fine, please tell her I'll be there at 4:00. And Dr. White, one more thing, could you tell me where your office is? Janet told me where your class is, but she didn't give me directions to your office.    A: Well, I'm in Room 302 of the Gregory Building. I'll tell my secretary to put the paper in my mail box, and I'll get it when I return.    B: I sure appreciate it. Goodbye, Dr. White.    A: Goodbye, Ms. Johnson. ",

I'm just sitting here in traffic. There must be an accident or something. I've been here for 30 minutes, and I've barely made it onto the bridge.    B: Oh, that's not good.    A: This traffic is really stressing me out. I don't want to have to take a later flight!    B: I'm sure you'll be able to make it. The plane doesn't leave for another 2 hours.    A: Yes, but Google Maps is telling me that I won't be at the airport for another hour and 45 minutes, which means I'll only have 15 minutes to check my bags, get through security, and arrive at the gate. That's impossible!    B: You can ask to skip to the head of the line in security. They're usually pretty good about that when you think you might miss your flight.    A: I hope so.",

B: Oh, I have a paper to work on, and I just couldn't do any serious studying at the beach.    A: I don't blame you. So what did you do out there? I mean besides lying out in the sun.    B: I ran slowly up and down the beach, and 1 played some volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't even get through a whole game before I had to sit down.    A: Did you go swimming?    B: I wanted to, but they said the water isn't warm enough for that until a couple of months from now.    A: It all sounds nice.

I wouldn't bother with it, to be honest, but I have to read it for a seminar. I'm at a university.    A: It's a labor of labor then rather than a labor of love.    B: I should say, I don't like Dickens at all really, the author, indeed, I am starting to like the whole course less and less.    A: It's not just the book, it's the curse as well?    B: Yeah, in a way, although the curse itself isn't really that bad, a lot of it is pretty good, in fact, and the lecturer is fine, as to me, I suppose, you see, I want to do philosophy rather than English, but my parents took me out of it.    A: So the courses are OK as such, it's just that had if been left to you, you would choose a different one.    B: Oh, they had my best interest and heart of course, my parents, they always do, don't they? They believe that my job prospect would be pretty limited with the degree of philosophy. Plus, they give me a really generous allowance, but I am beginning to feel that I'm wasting my time and their money. They would be so disappointed though if I told them I was quitting. ",

I was laid up in a hospital over there for three weeks.    A: Three weeks, that's a long time. What did you do while you were in the hospital?    B: Well, if you can believe it, I read all about motorcycle racing. I love racing even if it hurts.    A: But I'm afraid you don't make it look very funny. You're lucky to be alive.    B: That's for sure. I am lucky to be alive.    A: How soon can you get well? Did the doctor tell you about it?    B: They say I still need to stay in bed for two weeks or so.    A: I think you'll get a bit fatter by then. By the way, is there anything I can do for you?    B: No, thank you. Thank you for the beautiful flowers. It's very kind of you to come to see me.

A: You're probably right. But where are you going to live?    B: I hope I'll find a flat to share with somebody. That way it will be cheaper.    A: Yes, that's a good idea. Are you taking your dog with you?    B: No, I don't think so. My parents have offered to take care of him, and I don't think he'd be happy in the city.    A: You're probably right. But aren't you afraid of moving to such a big place, especially after living in a small village?    B: Not really. I think I'll enjoy myself. There's so much to do there; I expect I won't miss the countryside much and I can always come back and visit.    A: Well, I just hope you'll invite me to stay when you get settled.

I need to return some books. They are due today. Besides, I can also read some weekly publications, magazines and newspapers.    A: Great. We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that.    B: Sounds a good idea. Summer is approaching. Today's temperature has reached 35 degree Centigrade. Are you good at swimming?    A: Well, that's a good question. I haven't swum for almost two years. I think I need more practice.    B: Oh, it's almost 9. I need to hurry. I am running late now. See you after class at the gate of the library then. Bye!    A: See you then.",

You shouldn't have stayed home and worked on that paper. I think you would have been inspired by some of the paintings.    A: Oh, I don't know. I don't really care for modern art.    B: I think you should think of modern art like food. You need to taste things to see if you like them. You know, some of the pieces at the exhibition were even for sale. The last one was on sale for $9,000.    A: $9,000? Well, I may go and visit the exhibition tomorrow, but I'm not going to buy anything.    B: OK, let me know how it goes, won't you? And you might give Tom a call. He wanted to go with me today but his aunt was in town so he couldn't. He really wants to go.    A: OK, I will. ",

Now that the weather is warming up, I thought I should get some exercise instead of taking the bus all the time.    A: Well, that's a good idea and you come to the right place. Do you know what you like?    B: Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that. Mostly I'll just be using it to get me back and forth from work.    A: How far is that?    B: About four miles.    A: Are there a lot of hills on the way?    B: Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that?    A: Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition.    B: That sounds good.    A: And you are right. For the kind of ride you are going to be doing, the most important thing is comfort. You want to make sure it's the right height for you? Follow me and I'll show you what we've got. ",

A: You don't like evening classes?    B: That's not the point. I work in the cafe every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition.    A: You can ask someone that could switch hours with you. Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week.    B: I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again.    A: Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day.    B: That's a great idea. I'm free this afternoon. I'll go over and check it out.    A: Their courses are actually cheaper.

What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good?    B: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration.    A: I see.    B: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise?    A: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do.    B: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports?    A: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV    B: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself.    A: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming.    B: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?    A: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.",

He's here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one ot the word's wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report?    B: You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen.    A: Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now.    B: Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment.    A: Such as...?    B: There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives.    A: What needs to be done?    B: Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries.    A: So you are hopeful for the future.    B: As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren't wasted, as they were in the past. ",

A: If you want, we can order another pen just like this one.    B: That sounds like a good idea. Would you please go ahead and do that?    A: We'd be very happy to. It will take a week or ten days.

A: Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks?    B: That's not really the point. The campaign missed two key trade affairs. Because of this, we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free, or we only pay 50% of the fee for this year.    A: Could we suggest a 20% reduction to the fee together with the four week sustention to the campaign.    B: We are not happy. We lost business.    A: I think we both made mistakes. The responsibility is on both sides.    B: Ok, let's suggest a new solution. How about a 40% cut in fee, or a free repeat campaign?    A: Well, let's take a break, we're not getting very far.

It seems so cool, so in high school, I started a web-designed company and learned a lot from that experience.    A: How did you find the money for your present company then?    B: We've raised 18 million dollars from about 50 people. We're finally making money. I own 6% of the company and all employees get their shares.    A: By the way, what aspects of your life are green?    B: I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada.    A: Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful?    B: We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design. They make the products then. ",

B: And why are you so concerned about the show time?    A: Well, I don't know if I'll get all of my homework done before then.

A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack.    A: Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example?    B: Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies.    A: You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh?    B: Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.    A: Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public?    B: Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \"Aaah\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed.    A: What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?    B: Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference! ",

But speaking didn't help me learn to read and write Chinese.    B: My students won't want to read and write English, at lease not now. They are more interested in speaking.    A: You sound very knowledgeable about all this. How do you know so much?    B: I took a Teaching English as a Second Language course last year when you were in China.

Also, I was told that if you're stuck outdoors, the best thing you can do is to keep yourself close to the ground and avoid bodies of water.    B: To tell you the truth, even when I'm at home, I don't take baths or showers during a thunderstorm. And I don't use anything that works electrically. Maybe I'm too anxious.    A: I wouldn't say that. According to the article, lightning starts thousands of fires every year in the United States alone. Hundreds of people are injured or even killed. I think you're just being sensible. ",

It would be easier to chip the rock away than to get the barnacles off.    A: Exactly, and that's why scientists are trying to figure out what the barnacles glue is made of. It's considered one of the strongest adhesives in nature.    B: And it would have the advantage of being able to work on wet surfaces too.    A: Precisely, and because it's natural protein, it probably wouldn't be harmful to people like so many synthetic glues in use today.

B: You can get wine and beer in most pubs. Many also serve coffee. You go to the counter to order and pay for your drinks.    A: When do people go to the pubs?    B: Pubs are not open all day. They can decide when to open. Most are open for 3 or 4 hours at lunchtime and again from about 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. In busy areas, pubs may stay open from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Are there pubs in China?    A: Yes. Most of the customers are young people. They like to hang out with their friends after work and have fun.    B: It is against the law in England to go into a pub if you are under the age of l4.

You see, I put some soil in the box, sow the seed carefully like this, and then cover it with more soil. I'll keep the box in the shade so that the sun doesn't burn the little plants.    A: Is that all?    B: No. Later, in a few weeks' time I'll put the little plants in the earth. Then I'll water them to stop the soil from getting too dry. Several weeks after that, I will plant them in rows in the field.    A: Do you have to feed plants like you feed chickens? Or do they grow up by themselves?    B: In fact they grow better if you feed them. When the plants are in the ground I'll put some powder on the soil. The powder is made from fish, blood and bones. It'll make the cabbage plants grow big and strong.    A: Like me! ",

So naturally he went to the man and asked him whether his name was Smith. And the man, I mean, his grandfather, said yes, and after that everything happened just like a film.    B: Amazing.

It usually has articles and stories about current affairs about science, as well as papers about new developments in research, I'm reading about a new telephone that allows you to see the person you are speaking to, as well as hear him.    A: Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one?    B: No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving.    A: Oh, that's interesting.    B: You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you?    A: Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs?    B: Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds.    A: Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think?    B: Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation.

I know you make heavy machines yourselves. But I wonder if you also use machines imported from abroad.    B: Most of them are made in China, some even by our factory. Only a few were bought from other countries.    A: But I see the machines turned out here are quite modem and efficient.    B: Following the national policy of self - reliance and hard - working struggle, we've tried our best in the past few years to improve our equipment. However, there is still a lot more to do.    A: Now the question about yourself. I hope you don't mind it. How much do you earn each month?    B: My monthly wage is 3,500 RMB, not including the extra pay of about 500 for extra work I put in.    A: That sounds reasonable indeed. I'm very interested in worker's welfare here. What other benefits do you workers get, I wonder?    B: Like other factories in China, our factory offers free medical service for workers. ",

B: Yes. I suppose you could call it that. I couldn't see the town for the buildings.    A: But you've got to have the details in this kind of subject. Anyway I think he's good. You take his first lecture for instance. I thought that was very interesting, and not at all over-detailed.    B: Well, he starts off all right, but then he just piles on the details.    A: Now you're exaggerating.    B: Well, the way he dealt with the Western developments, that wasn't bad, I suppose.    A: You seem to have got something. Perhaps Potter is a little disorganized, but I think he's good.    B: Do you really think so?    A: He does do most of his teaching to the postgraduates. He only does the one undergraduate course each year. After all, I think he tends to forget where he is. He starts off being nice and general and then tries to cram in a bit too much specialized information.    B: The main thing I object to is the lack of direction. ",

A: Look-Look gets a lot of information about the ever-shifting tastes of the youth market by these images.    B: Yes, its clients are mostly companies. They get information about trends from Look-Look and develop their products. They also use the images of Look-Look on their websites to impress young people and promote their newly designed products.    A: But are there any people who don't like their pictures to be used on the website?    B: I always have my subjects' permission before I take their pictures and put up their images onto Look-Look.com.    A: Where do you find your best subjects?    B: At school, in the park, at local supermarkets and near many music clubs.    A: What is difficult about this job?    B: To catch our original styles because so many young people try hard to stand out.

A: Oh, it's not like that. We're a small nonprofit organization, and we're hoping to save our local papers and all the jobs they create.    B: Oh, that's an awesome cause! Fire away!    A: Great. So, tell me what you like about newspapers.    B: Well, there is a certain feel to holding a paper and turning the pages. The touch and sound of the paper as I fold it are so pleasant... A tablet can't give you this kind of feeling at all.    A: Do you usually read the whole paper or go through different sections to pick out your favorite articles?    B: I like being able to look around and find what I want. I can do this very quickly with a newspaper, but online news is tough for me to sort through. It takes me forever just to find something good, and sometimes when I do, it turns out to be something different!    A: Do you dislike anything about your newspaper?    B: Well, the only thing I can think of is all the ads nowadays. But it's even worse online, so I guess the answer is no! ",

B: But don't you watch the Cup finals and the great international matches between British teams and other national teams?    A: Very rarely. My favourite game is cricket. I used to be quite a good cricket player when I was at school and I've kept it up ever since.    B: It's a very English game, isn't it?    A: Yes, it is.

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store?    B: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.    A: You mean you don't keep regular hours?    B: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early.    A: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?    B: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.    A: Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business. ",

A: Well, I can certainly understand that you're upset about losing them and we'll do all we can to help. If they really are missing,it's a matter for the police.    B: What do you mean, if they are missing? I told you they were.    A: Yes, Sir. But first I'll have one of the housekeeping staff look through your room in case they're still there. But I must say that we can't be held responsible. You should have deposited the valuables with Reception. It says so on the Key Card.    B: That's not good enough. I want to see the manager immediately.    A: I'll be glad to call the duty manager for you, sir. But he'll certainly say the same. We have clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them.

A: We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm?    B: I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.    A: Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye.    B: Yeah, it's a really sad day for America.    A: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?    B: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago.    A: Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?    B: The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage. ",

A: So, it was very hard.    B: Yes, very hard. Sometimes, it's difficult to walk in the mountains where the air is very thin, and you have a lot of problems when breathing.    A: What kind of equipment did you take?    B: Not much. Only a bag, a sleeping bag and some warm clothing. We carried all the things by ourselves.    A: And how was the food?    B: There was rice and some vegetables, normally no meat. But it was good.    A: What was the best thing about the trip?    B: The walking and the exercise.

I don't think the sun has been down for more than a few hours the whole time I've been here.    B: Yeah, that's another interesting thing about the summers here. We're so far north that we're exposed to the sun for almost the entire day. In winter, the opposite is true.    A: You mean it's dark the whole time?    B: Well, not the whole time... but maybe for two-thirds of every day from December to February.    A: Whoa! How do you make it through every year? As a California native, I wouldn't be able to handle that for more than one season!    B: I guess I'm used to it. When I was a kid, it was pretty fun to play with flashlights and have campfires outside in the afternoon. I never noticed that life was worse because it was always dark. ",

Can you tell me something about your school work?    B: As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable.    A: That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job?    B: Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right?    A: That's right.    B: And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well.    A: So, you would like to write material for computers, would you?    B: Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into.    A: I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you.

Then he gets around them to make him a cup of tea, and while they are out of the room he steals their money, handbag whatever and makes off with it.    B: But you know, Jane, it's partly their own fault. You should never let anyone like that in unless you're expecting them.    A: It's all very well to say that. But someone comes to the door, and says electricity or gas and you automatically think they are OK, especially if they flash a card to you    B: Does this man have an ID then?    A: Yes, that's just it. It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time. According to the paper the police are warning people especially pensioners not to admit anyone unless they have an appointment. It's a bit sad. One old lady told them she'd just been to the post\u2013office to draw her pension when he called. She said he must have followed her home. He stole the whole lot.    B: But what does he look like?

A: well , some people are like that .    that 's all .    you ca n't let them bother you .    one nice thing about chat room is that you can leave and go to another one . ",
