B: Yeah, it's really an exciting hobby. You know, the first postage stamps were issued in Britain in 1840.    A: Really? I didn't know that. What's on the first postage stamps?    B: Well, look, here's a picture of the first two stamps issued.    A: Oh, they both bear a picture of Queen Victoria, don't they?    B: Yes, I wish I had the originals, then I would be a wealthy man instead of a poor stamp collector.    A: But I believe collecting stamps gives you much pleasure which not all wealthy men can enjoy.    B: Yes, I do agree. ",

You could set it ahead of the exact time so that you could have got up earlier and not have been late.    B: I did that, but it seemed useless when I found the batteries had run out after I woke up this morning. I rushed to school and luckily, my neighbour Mr. Green gave me a hand and took me to school with his car.    A: So you could have made it. But you were still late for class.    B: The thing is, when I got off, I found I had left my bag in his car. And it was too late to get it back when I realized that. I went straight to the nearest shop and gave him a call. I waited for five minutes before Mr. Green drove back.    A: Finally, he gave you your bag and you came to the classroom and you were already 15 minutes late for class at that time. Is that all?

A: Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives.    B: Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children.    A: How?    B: We tell them we love them and will always do.    A: You haven't thought of saving the marriage?    B: Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer.    A: Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it.    B: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing.    A: Yet most people believe a had marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think?    B: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits.

A: No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly.    B: What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure?    A: Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers.    B: Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language?    A: Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction.    B: How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident?    A: The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet.    B: So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.    A: Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.    B: Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other. ",

Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here?    B: Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains.    A: Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice?    B: Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance.    A: But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States?    B: Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life.

The other senses seem to be more concrete somehow, but smell is so personal. I found it extremely interesting.    A: Do you have any interesting information to give us about smells?    B: Well, let's see. Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time.    A: Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music?    B: That seems to be the case.    A: That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell?    B: Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports. Then I know I am going to fly somewhere exciting. But it's the general smell of my garden in the rain that I really like the most. That means I am at home where I should be. ",

I've hardly moved forward in that time.    A: Are you kidding?    B: Not at all. There was a couple up ahead of me who got so fed up that they finally gave up and left. They said they'd been here for more than an hour.    A: My God. Does anyone know what's causing the delay?    B: It could be that there aren't enough people selling tickets this afternoon. Or maybe their computers break down.    A: I just hope they don't run out of tickets when I get up there.    B: That really would be annoying, wouldn't it?    A: I guess I should have come before lunch. Or has it been like this all day?    B: Actually it has. In fact, before I came, I tried calling to order my tickets over the phone, just to avoid this long wait, but they don't take phone orders, or checks, or credit cards. It's cash or nothing. And you have to come in person.    A: Well, there are two more hours before the ticket office closes. Tickets to a good concert are worth waiting for. So I think i'll just make myself comfortable. ",

        "utterances": "A: Good morning, Mr. Tim. It's a long time since I had the pleasure of a visit from you.    B: Yes, it must be three or four years. I haven't visited you since I called about my will. You helped me with that, you remember?    A: Yes, I remember. Do you want to make any changes in your will?    B: I don't think that will be necessary, but you'll tell me if it is. I left everything, you remember, to my wife, and, after her death, to my son Jerry. I've about $ 15 000 in shares of industrial companies. These bring in, after paying tax, about $ 1 125 a year. Well, I'm earning a good salary now, and I shall get a good pension from my employers, so my wife and I can live fairly comfortably with this extra income. I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him.    A: Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house.    B: Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect.    A: Have you found a plot yet?    B: Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me.    A: I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land. You're not allowed to build a house without permission from the Planning Authority. And sometimes the Authority decides that a house must be built of stone, and not of brick, so that it doesn't spoil the surrounding village. ",

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today.    B: That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket.    A: You look as if you've lost weight as well.    B: I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me.    A: Have you been to the doctor? What did she say?    B: I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious.    A: You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

I wondered if you could do some catering for us next week, we are having a small reception. It's to launch our summer holiday advertising campaign. Will you be free?    A: When exactly is it? Mr. Smith?    B: April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday.    A: Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it?    B: We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there.    A: Ok. What sort of things would you like?    B: Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again.    A: Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for?    B: Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure.    A: Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week.    B: Ok. ",

A: So the courses are OK as such, it's just that had if been left to you, you would choose a different one.

You shouldn't have stayed home and worked on that paper. I think you would have been inspired by some of the paintings.    A: Oh, I don't know. I don't really care for modern art.    B: I think you should think of modern art like food. You need to taste things to see if you like them. You know, some of the pieces at the exhibition were even for sale. The last one was on sale for $9,000.    A: $9,000? Well, I may go and visit the exhibition tomorrow, but I'm not going to buy anything.    B: OK, let me know how it goes, won't you? And you might give Tom a call. He wanted to go with me today but his aunt was in town so he couldn't. He really wants to go.    A: OK, I will. ",

Now that the weather is warming up, I thought I should get some exercise instead of taking the bus all the time.    A: Well, that's a good idea and you come to the right place. Do you know what you like?    B: Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that. Mostly I'll just be using it to get me back and forth from work.    A: How far is that?    B: About four miles.    A: Are there a lot of hills on the way?    B: Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that?    A: Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition.    B: That sounds good.    A: And you are right. For the kind of ride you are going to be doing, the most important thing is comfort. You want to make sure it's the right height for you? Follow me and I'll show you what we've got. ",

That was really an unusual day.    B: I think you should be a weather reporter. You know a lot about the weather.    A: Thanks. I want to be a weather reporter when I finish school.

B: You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen.    A: Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now.    B: Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment.    A: Such as...?    B: There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives.    A: What needs to be done?    B: Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries.    A: So you are hopeful for the future.    B: As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

First of all, the campaign was late. It missed two important trade affairs. The ads also did not appear into key magazines. As a result, the campaign failed. Do you accept that summary of what happened?    A: Well, the delay wasn't entirely our fault. You did in fact make late changes to the specifications of the advertisements.    B: Uh, actually, you were late with the initial proposals so you have very little time and in fact, we only asked for small changes.    A: Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks?    B: That's not really the point. The campaign missed two key trade affairs. Because of this, we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free, or we only pay 50% of the fee for this year.    A: Could we suggest a 20% reduction to the fee together with the four week sustention to the campaign.    B: We are not happy. We lost business.    A: I think we both made mistakes. The responsibility is on both sides.    B: Ok, let's suggest a new solution. How about a 40% cut in fee, or a free repeat campaign?    A: Well, let's take a break, we're not getting very far.

It seems so cool, so in high school, I started a web-designed company and learned a lot from that experience.    A: How did you find the money for your present company then?    B: We've raised 18 million dollars from about 50 people. We're finally making money. I own 6% of the company and all employees get their shares.    A: By the way, what aspects of your life are green?    B: I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada.    A: Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful?    B: We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design.

A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack.    A: Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example?    B: Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies.    A: You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh?    B: Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.    A: Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public?    B: Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \"Aaah\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed.    A: What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?    B: Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference! ",

You see, I put some soil in the box, sow the seed carefully like this, and then cover it with more soil. I'll keep the box in the shade so that the sun doesn't burn the little plants.    A: Is that all?    B: No. Later, in a few weeks' time I'll put the little plants in the earth. Then I'll water them to stop the soil from getting too dry. Several weeks after that, I will plant them in rows in the field.    A: Do you have to feed plants like you feed chickens? Or do they grow up by themselves?    B: In fact they grow better if you feed them. When the plants are in the ground I'll put some powder on the soil. The powder is made from fish, blood and bones.

A: Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one?    B: No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving.    A: Oh, that's interesting.    B: You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you?    A: Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs?    B: Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds.    A: Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think?    B: Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation.

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store?    B: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.    A: You mean you don't keep regular hours?    B: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early.    A: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?    B: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.    A: Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business. ",

A: We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm?    B: I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.    A: Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye.    B: Yeah, it's a really sad day for America.    A: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?    B: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago.    A: Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?    B: The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage. ",

A: How long did you stay there?    B: 20 days.    A: 20 days! That's a long time. How far did you walk every day?    B: Perhaps 15 kilometers. You have to climb up and down a lot every day.    A: So, it was very hard.    B: Yes, very hard. Sometimes, it's difficult to walk in the mountains where the air is very thin, and you have a lot of problems when breathing.    A: What kind of equipment did you take?    B: Not much. Only a bag, a sleeping bag and some warm clothing. We carried all the things by ourselves.    A: And how was the food?    B: There was rice and some vegetables, normally no meat. But it was good.    A: What was the best thing about the trip?    B: The walking and the exercise. I hate sitting in the sun and like to be out in the countryside. The air is very clean and it's very quiet. Nepal is a good place. You must go! ",

We're so far north that we're exposed to the sun for almost the entire day. In winter, the opposite is true.    A: You mean it's dark the whole time?

As a California native, I wouldn't be able to handle that for more than one season!    B: I guess I'm used to it.

Can you tell me something about your school work?    B: As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable.    A: That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job?    B: Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right?    A: That's right.    B: And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well.    A: So, you would like to write material for computers, would you?    B: Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into.    A: I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you.

Then he gets around them to make him a cup of tea, and while they are out of the room he steals their money, handbag whatever and makes off with it.    B: But you know, Jane, it's partly their own fault. You should never let anyone like that in unless you're expecting them.    A: It's all very well to say that. But someone comes to the door, and says electricity or gas and you automatically think they are OK, especially if they flash a card to you    B: Does this man have an ID then?    A: Yes, that's just it. It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time. According to the paper the police are warning people especially pensioners not to admit anyone unless they have an appointment. It's a bit sad. One old lady told them she'd just been to the post\u2013office to draw her pension when he called. She said he must have followed her home. He stole the whole lot.    B: But what does he look like?
