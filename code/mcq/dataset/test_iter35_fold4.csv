3515,dream-0820-triplet-3,0,What does 'watched funny movies' cause?,"We've all heard the saying 'Laughter is the best medicine.' How important is it to our health, Dr. Berk? This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say 'Aaah' while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed. What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?

This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say 'Aaah' while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed. What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?

I have joined a singing group and we practice two afternoons each week. That's a very interesting thing to do. Yes. It's a small group of only fifteen girls and boys. But nobody has been late for the practice. I see. How many songs can you sing now? We started only three months ago, but we've practiced eight songs. Are you going to perform any time? Yes, there will be a school show next month and we are going to sing a song in it. We are practicing a new song now. It's written by one of the singers in our group. Really? What's the name of the song? Sunny Days. That's a nice name. I hope to listen to it soon. Can I visit you when you practice?

Is everything alright? Morning, Mr. Jones. No, I haven't been out much recently. I've been feeling a bit under the weather. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't mind me saying, but you don't look very well. Your face is very pale. Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure.
