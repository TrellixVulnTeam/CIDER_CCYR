3370,dream-0436-triplet-1,0,What is implied by 'got divorced when I had small children'?,"Dear audiences, today we'll talk about divorce and its effect on children. Our guest is Jennifer Benzes. Thank you for coming, Jennifer. Do you mind saying something about your divorce? No. I got divorced years ago. Even worse, I got divorced when I had small children. Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives. Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children. How? We tell them we love them and will always do. You haven't thought of saving the marriage? Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer. Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it. It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing. Yet most people believe a had marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think? I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarrelling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children. What do you want society to do for you? Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future.

Do you have any interesting information to give us about smells? Well, let's see. Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time. Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music? That seems to be the case. That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell? Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports. Then I know I am going to fly somewhere exciting. But it's the general smell of my garden in the rain that I really like the most. That means I am at home where I should be.

No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding. Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.

Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding. Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.

Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports.

3378,dream-0441-triplet-1,0,What is 'air crash'?,"Did you hear about the air crash that occurred in South America recently? It was quite a tragic accident! No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding. Wow, that's a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.
