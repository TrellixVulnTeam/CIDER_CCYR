Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business.

You know I've been working for the Merry Lynch Bank for over 15 years. So you are thinking of making a change,are you? Yes, I am. Actually, you know, I'm thinking of beginning my own business. That sounds great. Yes, I think it over, but the problem is money. If I had enough money, I'd leave the bank tomorrow. What are you going to do to solve the problem? I'll borrow some money from a bank, of course, but not from the one I've been working for. ",What prerequisite does 'beginning my own business' have?,gen,work,leave the bank,money,working,1

3451,dream-0808-triplet-7,0,What desire is caused by 'the campaign was late'?,"Can we make you an offer? We would like to run the campaign for four extra weeks. Well, can we summarize the problem from my point of view? First of all, the campaign was late. It missed two important trade affairs. The ads also did not appear into key magazines. As a result, the campaign failed. Do you accept that summary of what happened? Well, the delay wasn't entirely our fault. You did in fact make late changes to the specifications of the advertisements. Uh, actually, you were late with the initial proposals so you have very little time and in fact, we only asked for small changes. Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks? That's not really the point. The campaign missed two key trade affairs. Because of this, we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free, or we only pay 50% of the fee for this year. Could we suggest a 20% reduction to the fee together with the four week sustention to the campaign. We are not happy. We lost business. I think we both made mistakes. The responsibility is on both sides. Ok, let's suggest a new solution. How about a 40% cut in fee, or a free repeat campaign? Well, let's take a break, we're not getting very far. Perhaps we should think about this. ",What desire is caused by 'the campaign was late'?,gen,take a break,lost business,pay 50% of the fee,ads,2
