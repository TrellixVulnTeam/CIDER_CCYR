I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me. I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land. You're not allowed to build a house without permission from the Planning Authority.

3519,dream-0820-triplet-7,0,What is 'laughing'?,"We've all heard the saying 'Laughter is the best medicine.' How important is it to our health, Dr. Berk? This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say 'Aaah' while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed. What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh? Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference!

Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

3784,dream-0879-triplet-2,0,What prerequisite does 'afford to buy their own products' have?,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

3787,dream-0879-triplet-5,0,What does 'shutting down 14 plants' cause?,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?

No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened? A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill! That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.

Did anyone survive? No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.

Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here? Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.
