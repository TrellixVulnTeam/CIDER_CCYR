She's afraid she won't be able to attend your class this afternoon. I'm calling to see whether it would be OK if I gave you her essay. Certainly, that would be fine. Uh, you can either drop it off at my class or bring it to my office. Would it be all right to come by your office around 4:00? I'm afraid I can't come any earlier because I have three classes this afternoon. Uh, I won't be here when you come. I'm supposed to be at a meeting from 3:00 to 6:00, but how about leaving it with my secretary? She usually stays until 5:00. Fine, please tell her I'll be there at 4:00. And Dr. White, one more thing, could you tell me where your office is? Janet told me where your class is, but she didn't give me directions to your office. Well, I'm in Room 302 of the Gregory Building. I'll tell my secretary to put the paper in my mail box, and I'll get it when I return. I sure appreciate it. Goodbye, Dr. White.

Some friends of my parents' live out there and they invited me for as long as I wanted to stay. So what are you doing back here already? Oh, I have a paper to work on, and I just couldn't do any serious studying at the beach. I don't blame you. So what did you do out there? I mean besides lying out in the sun. I ran slowly up and down the beach, and 1 played some volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't even get through a whole game before I had to sit down. Did you go swimming? I wanted to, but they said the water isn't warm enough for that until a couple of months from now. It all sounds nice. I wish I could get away to the beach like that. coming back home moderately warm water",

I should say, I don't like Dickens at all really, the author, indeed, I am starting to like the whole course less and less. It's not just the book, it's the curse as well? Yeah, in a way, although the curse itself isn't really that bad, a lot of it is pretty good, in fact, and the lecturer is fine, as to me, I suppose, you see, I want to do philosophy rather than English, but my parents took me out of it. So the courses are OK as such, it's just that had if been left to you, you would choose a different one. Oh, they had my best interest and heart of course, my parents, they always do, don't they? They believe that my job prospect would be pretty limited with the degree of philosophy. Plus, they give me a really generous allowance, but I am beginning to feel that I'm wasting my time and their money. They would be so disappointed though if I told them I was quitting. ",

Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that. Mostly I'll just be using it to get me back and forth from work. How far is that? About four miles. Are there a lot of hills on the way? Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that? Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition. That sounds good. And you are right. For the kind of ride you are going to be doing, the most important thing is comfort. You want to make sure it's the right height for you? Follow me and I'll show you what we've got. ",

Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day.

No, there's plenty of room, but I have to take the starter course before I can take Professor Miller's Shakespeare course. It is only offered in the evening. You don't like evening classes? That's not the point. I work in the cafe every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition. You can ask someone that could switch hours with you. Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day. That's a great idea. I'm free this afternoon. I'll go over and check it out. Their courses are actually cheaper. Thanks for your advice. I'll let you know what happens. Sure.

What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. I see. How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that. carry water and towel to the gym do exercise together",

Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too.

Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that. carry water and towel to the gym do exercise together",

I hope it works out for you. But wasn't it expensive just getting here? No, in fact the company is paying all my expenses. They've put me up in a hotel downtown. How nice! How many people are they interviewing? They interviewed 16 the first time, and now four of us were chosen to go back for this interview. Well, I hope it goes well. John and I would love it if you came to this area to work. I would too. But my girlfriend doesn't want to leave her family. She hopes I find a job close to home. Oh, What a decision. Good luck. ",

No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers.

Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.

We have to pay the dustman for dealing with rubbish, but if we sell him these cans and other reusable material we pay less. That sounds a clever idea. Now what are reused in China? Metal, plastic, paper, books and the like. Just as we do back home in the States. And to avoid waste, the government is limiting the production of goods that can be used only once, such as bamboo chopsticks. For example, all the fast food boxes should be made of paper instead of non-reusable material. That will surely be helpful for a clean environment. ",

Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks? That's not really the point. The campaign missed two key trade affairs. Because of this, we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free, or we only pay 50% of the fee for this year. Could we suggest a 20% reduction to the fee together with the four week sustention to the campaign. We are not happy. We lost business. I think we both made mistakes. The responsibility is on both sides. Ok, let's suggest a new solution. How about a 40% cut in fee, or a free repeat campaign? Well, let's take a break, we're not getting very far.

OK, I get your point. It's just so hard. You don't really understand because you have never smoked. You need some help. Why don't you go to a doctor? You mean a psychiatrist? No, I don't. I mean a general practitioner. Maybe you can get a patch, or some pills, well, I don't know, something to help you with the withdrawal. Really, I believe I can quit on my own. But I'll think about it. I will. All fight. I won't mention it for a week. Then I want to know your decision. Because if you don't get some help, I need to rethink our plans.

You see, I put some soil in the box, sow the seed carefully like this, and then cover it with more soil. I'll keep the box in the shade so that the sun doesn't burn the little plants. Is that all? No. Later, in a few weeks' time I'll put the little plants in the earth. Then I'll water them to stop the soil from getting too dry. Several weeks after that, I will plant them in rows in the field. Do you have to feed plants like you feed chickens? Or do they grow up by themselves? In fact they grow better if you feed them. When the plants are in the ground I'll put some powder on the soil. The powder is made from fish, blood and bones. It'll make the cabbage plants grow big and strong. Like me! ",

I am taking three genera] requirements and American history and American literature this. semester. Last semester I took four requirements and freshman French. I believe it's not too late to change your major because you've mainly taken general requirements which all freshmen have to take. Also we have twelve electives so the mo lit courses will be included in them, so you can change your major without losing any credit hours. I am very happy to know I am still able to change my major. I am interested in writing newspaper articles, and after finishing my degree I would like to work for some newspaper firm. Oh, I think you will be a good writer. Dr. Steven, when do students start practical training? They don't begin practical training in reporting until the sophomore year. Journalism 121 normally is taken in the freshman year as a general background course. I see. I will take the course next semester. Thank you very much for your help. You're welcome. I look forward to seeing you in my department. ",

I'm also doing a paper on how Japanese management styles are being adapted by American firms for my Comparative Cultures class. Why don't we sit down and share some of our sources after we've each been to the library? Great idea! Should we meet at the snack bar next Wednesday at this time? That's fine with me. See you then.

I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way.

You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week.

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business. ",

If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

How long did you stay there? 20 days. 20 days! That's a long time. How far did you walk every day? Perhaps 15 kilometers. You have to climb up and down a lot every day. So, it was very hard. Yes, very hard. Sometimes, it's difficult to walk in the mountains where the air is very thin, and you have a lot of problems when breathing. What kind of equipment did you take? Not much. Only a bag, a sleeping bag and some warm clothing. We carried all the things by ourselves. And how was the food? There was rice and some vegetables, normally no meat. But it was good. What was the best thing about the trip? The walking and the exercise. I hate sitting in the sun and like to be out in the countryside. The air is very clean and it's very quiet.

However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into. I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you. Thank you, madam.

Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into. I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you. Thank you, madam.

Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here? Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life. I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding. ",

Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here? Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life. I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding. ",

Or maybe their computers break down. I just hope they don't run out of tickets when I get up there. That really would be annoying, wouldn't it? I guess I should have come before lunch. Or has it been like this all day? Actually it has. In fact, before I came, I tried calling to order my tickets over the phone, just to avoid this long wait, but they don't take phone orders, or checks, or credit cards. It's cash or nothing. And you have to come in person. Well, there are two more hours before the ticket office closes. Tickets to a good concert are worth waiting for. So I think i'll just make myself comfortable. ",
