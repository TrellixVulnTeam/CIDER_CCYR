I'll be there at 1:30, then. But why did you decide to coach a football team? Well, I thought it might be a bad idea at first, because I was so busy at work. But then I thought, why not? ",

I just got back from Africa where I had a terrible accident in a motorcycle race. I broke both my legs when my motor failed and was hit by another motorcycle. I was laid up in a hospital over there for three weeks. Three weeks, that's a long time. What did you do while you were in the hospital? Well, if you can believe it, I read all about motorcycle racing. I love racing even if it hurts. But I'm afraid you don't make it look very funny. You're lucky to be alive. That's for sure. I am lucky to be alive. How soon can you get well? Did the doctor tell you about it? They say I still need to stay in bed for two weeks or so. I think you'll get a bit fatter by then. By the way, is there anything I can do for you? No, thank you. Thank you for the beautiful flowers. It's very kind of you to come to see me. I'll be going then. Bye.

Just in the last few weeks. I get a very sharp pain about an hour after having meals. I see. Do you get this after every meal? Let me think. No, it's usually in the afternoon, after lunch. Well, what do you have for lunch? Oh, I mostly just have a quick hamburger and rush back to the office. We're very busy at the moment. Well, I don't think it's a serious thing. Maybe you eat too quickly. It's bad for your health. My husband is always telling me that. Anyway, I'll give you something for it and see what happens. Take the medicine three times a day. After meals or before? After eating. Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. ",

Also, I'm worried that I won't be smart enough to get good grades at a difficult college. I could go to the University of California, but I don't think they have a good teaching school. Most importantly, I want to go to a school that is famous for teaching. Those are all excellent schools, James. If you're accepted into all those schools, you should consider yourself very fortunate. When I went to school, I went to a very small college, and I still got a great job as principal. You will be successful because you work very hard. Thanks for your help, Principal Skinner. ",

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

I wondered if you could do some catering for us next week, we are having a small reception. It's to launch our summer holiday advertising campaign. Will you be free? When exactly is it? Mr. Smith? April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok. ",

I will be on business in China from May 25 to June 2. Well, I'm sorry you have to be away on business then. Let me see. Another game, the US Open will be running from July 15 to July 18.
