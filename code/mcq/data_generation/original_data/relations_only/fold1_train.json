She's afraid she won't be able to attend your class this afternoon. I'm calling to see whether it would be OK if I gave you her essay. Certainly, that would be fine. Uh, you can either drop it off at my class or bring it to my office. Would it be all right to come by your office around 4:00? I'm afraid I can't come any earlier because I have three classes this afternoon. Uh, I won't be here when you come. I'm supposed to be at a meeting from 3:00 to 6:00, but how about leaving it with my secretary? She usually stays until 5:00. Fine, please tell her I'll be there at 4:00. And Dr. White, one more thing, could you tell me where your office is? Janet told me where your class is, but she didn't give me directions to your office.

I was laid up in a hospital over there for three weeks. Three weeks, that's a long time. What did you do while you were in the hospital? Well, if you can believe it, I read all about motorcycle racing. I love racing even if it hurts. But I'm afraid you don't make it look very funny. You're lucky to be alive. That's for sure. I am lucky to be alive. How soon can you get well? Did the doctor tell you about it? They say I still need to stay in bed for two weeks or so. I think you'll get a bit fatter by then. By the way, is there anything I can do for you? No, thank you. Thank you for the beautiful flowers. It's very kind of you to come to see me. I'll be going then. Bye.

Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day. That's a great idea. I'm free this afternoon. I'll go over and check it out. Their courses are actually cheaper. Thanks for your advice. I'll let you know what happens. Sure. Good luck! attend the course in evening",

How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

We had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of mineral water. I see. Well I'm sorry to hear that. The trouble is that we're a bit sort of hands at present. Two waitresses are ill. All right, but that's no excuse. My husband asked for goose and he was brought chicken instead. It's just unbelievable! And my beans weren't cooked properly. It wasn't a very enjoyable meal at all. This is most regrettable. Look at this bill. We've been overcharged. We only had one dessert, not two. Can you check the bill again, please? I do apologize, Madam. I'm afraid I'm not going to pay the service charge, or give a tip, as I don't feel satisfied with it. I'm quite disappointed as a matter of fact. I'll pass on your complaints to the manager right away. Thank you. ",

Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out.

It's a youth culture marketing and trend forecasting firm in Hollywood. I'm one of Look-Look's 65,000 trendspotters worldwide. Look-Look gets a lot of information about the ever-shifting tastes of the youth market by these images. Yes, its clients are mostly companies. They get information about trends from Look-Look and develop their products. They also use the images of Look-Look on their websites to impress young people and promote their newly designed products. But are there any people who don't like their pictures to be used on the website? I always have my subjects' permission before I take their pictures and put up their images onto Look-Look.com. Where do you find your best subjects? At school, in the park, at local supermarkets and near many music clubs. What is difficult about this job? To catch our original styles because so many young people try hard to stand out. You have to be able to find the difference between someone who is copying trends and someone who is truly inventing a new look. Thank you for talk with us, Emily. ",

A tablet can't give you this kind of feeling at all. Do you usually read the whole paper or go through different sections to pick out your favorite articles? I like being able to look around and find what I want. I can do this very quickly with a newspaper, but online news is tough for me to sort through. It takes me forever just to find something good, and sometimes when I do, it turns out to be something different! Do you dislike anything about your newspaper? Well, the only thing I can think of is all the ads nowadays. But it's even worse online, so I guess the answer is no! ",

I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way.

You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week.

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business. ",

You should have deposited the valuables with Reception. It says so on the Key Card. That's not good enough. I want to see the manager immediately. I'll be glad to call the duty manager for you, sir. But he'll certainly say the same. We have clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them. ",

However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right.

Can you tell me something about your school work? As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into. I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you. Thank you, madam. Good morning. ",

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok. ",

April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok. ",

Is this little girl you? Yes. And the little boy is my younger brother. The couple standing behind us is our parents. It is the only picture of my family. Hadn't you taken any pictures together before you took this one? Of course we did. But all the pictures were destroyed when a bomb destroyed our house. This picture survived because I always took it with me. Didn't you taken any picture after the bomb? Well, it was a sad story. My father was killed in that bombing. I'm sorry to hear that. War left many people sad memories. Yes. And I'm so glad we can lead such a peaceful life nowadays. ",
