She's afraid she won't be able to attend your class this afternoon. I'm calling to see whether it would be OK if I gave you her essay. Certainly, that would be fine. Uh, you can either drop it off at my class or bring it to my office. Would it be all right to come by your office around 4:00? I'm afraid I can't come any earlier because I have three classes this afternoon. Uh, I won't be here when you come.

Oh, I have a paper to work on, and I just couldn't do any serious studying at the beach. I don't blame you. So what did you do out there? I mean besides lying out in the sun. I ran slowly up and down the beach, and 1 played some volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't even get through a whole game before I had to sit down.

No, there's plenty of room, but I have to take the starter course before I can take Professor Miller's Shakespeare course. It is only offered in the evening. You don't like evening classes? That's not the point. I work in the cafe every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition. You can ask someone that could switch hours with you. Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day. That's a great idea. I'm free this afternoon. I'll go over and check it out. Their courses are actually cheaper. Thanks for your advice. I'll let you know what happens. Sure.

Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too.

What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. I see. How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?

What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. I see. How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that. carry water and towel to the gym do exercise together",

First of all, do you own a personal computer? Of course! Doesn't everyone? How long have you owned it? I bought this particular computer last year. But I got my first PC in 1995. I see. And what do you primarily use your computer for? Well, I use it to send e-mails a lot, and... um, I have a teach-yourself French program. And I shop online pretty often. Mmm. Any other uses? Keeping track of my bank account, and there are a couple of computer games I enjoy. Now you've mentioned e-mail and online shopping. Do you use the Internet for any other purposes? Not really. I haven't got around to explore it too much. Okay, thanks. Sorry to have given you so much trouble. Thanks again. ",

It's a great place to meet people. Now that you mentioned it, it would be nice to get away from the computer center for a change, and I really should get some more exercise. Working up a sweat in a ball game or the weight room would be nice. I've got so fat. Look at me -You're not the only one. In high school I had a lot more time to do sports activities. Now what little spare time you have must be used in doing exercise. At least the club is open until 12 pm. I guess it's worth a visit. Did you say you're going tomorrow night? Yeah. OK, I'll come, too. How about meeting me in front of the cinema at eight, and we'll catch the bus there. Sure, see you then. ",

He's here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one ot the word's wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report? You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment. Such as...? There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren't wasted, as they were in the past. ",

You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment. Such as...? There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren't wasted, as they were in the past. ",

I mean a general practitioner. Maybe you can get a patch, or some pills, well, I don't know, something to help you with the withdrawal. Really, I believe I can quit on my own. But I'll think about it. I will. All fight. I won't mention it for a week. Then I want to know your decision. Because if you don't get some help, I need to rethink our plans.

You can get wine and beer in most pubs. Many also serve coffee. You go to the counter to order and pay for your drinks. When do people go to the pubs? Pubs are not open all day. They can decide when to open. Most are open for 3 or 4 hours at lunchtime and again from about 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. In busy areas, pubs may stay open from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Are there pubs in China? Yes. Most of the customers are young people. They like to hang out with their friends after work and have fun. It is against the law in England to go into a pub if you are under the age of l4. So many pubs provide a special room for children. ",

It's a youth culture marketing and trend forecasting firm in Hollywood. I'm one of Look-Look's 65,000 trendspotters worldwide. Look-Look gets a lot of information about the ever-shifting tastes of the youth market by these images. Yes, its clients are mostly companies. They get information about trends from Look-Look and develop their products. They also use the images of Look-Look on their websites to impress young people and promote their newly designed products. But are there any people who don't like their pictures to be used on the website? I always have my subjects' permission before I take their pictures and put up their images onto Look-Look.com. Where do you find your best subjects? At school, in the park, at local supermarkets and near many music clubs. What is difficult about this job? To catch our original styles because so many young people try hard to stand out. You have to be able to find the difference between someone who is copying trends and someone who is truly inventing a new look. Thank you for talk with us, Emily. ",

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business. ",

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

How long did you stay there? 20 days. 20 days! That's a long time. How far did you walk every day? Perhaps 15 kilometers. You have to climb up and down a lot every day. So, it was very hard. Yes, very hard. Sometimes, it's difficult to walk in the mountains where the air is very thin, and you have a lot of problems when breathing. What kind of equipment did you take? Not much.

I've hardly moved forward in that time. Are you kidding? Not at all. There was a couple up ahead of me who got so fed up that they finally gave up and left. They said they'd been here for more than an hour. My God. Does anyone know what's causing the delay? It could be that there aren't enough people selling tickets this afternoon. Or maybe their computers break down. I just hope they don't run out of tickets when I get up there. That really would be annoying, wouldn't it? I guess I should have come before lunch. Or has it been like this all day? Actually it has. In fact, before I came, I tried calling to order my tickets over the phone, just to avoid this long wait, but they don't take phone orders, or checks, or credit cards. It's cash or nothing. And you have to come in person. Well, there are two more hours before the ticket office closes. Tickets to a good concert are worth waiting for. So I think i'll just make myself comfortable. ",

The nearest one is next to the bank. It's quite modern. Do you think there're any cheap ones nearby? Yes. Drive west for about two minutes and you will find one opposite to a supermarket. It's a family hotel, very comfortable, and the price is quite reasonable. It sounds nice. Thank you very much for your help. That's all right. ",

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

No, I haven't been out much recently. I've been feeling a bit under the weather. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't mind me saying, but you don't look very well. Your face is very pale. Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

No, we haven't any music homework, but the science teacher is giving us a test on Friday, so we have to study for that. Oh no. I'm so bad at science. I hate it. Thanks, Jack. Don't mention it.

The Houston Open will be running from May 26 to May 30. I'm sure you will be glad to watch the game. Oh, that's great. But just a moment, let me check. Ah... It is a pity that I can't make it. I will be on business in China from May 25 to June 2. Well, I'm sorry you have to be away on business then. Let me see. Another game, the US Open will be running from July 15 to July 18. How about that? That's great. I will be on my holiday then. It would be wonderful if we could watch the game together. ",
