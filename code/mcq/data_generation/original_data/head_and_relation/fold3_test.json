Now that the weather is warming up, I thought I should get some exercise instead of taking the bus all the time. Well, that's a good idea and you come to the right place. Do you know what you like? Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that. Mostly I'll just be using it to get me back and forth from work. How far is that? About four miles. Are there a lot of hills on the way? Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that? Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition. That sounds good. And you are right. For the kind of ride you are going to be doing, the most important thing is comfort. You want to make sure it's the right height for you? Follow me and I'll show you what we've got. ",

No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers.

The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

No. Later, in a few weeks' time I'll put the little plants in the earth. Then I'll water them to stop the soil from getting too dry. Several weeks after that, I will plant them in rows in the field. Do you have to feed plants like you feed chickens? Or do they grow up by themselves? In fact they grow better if you feed them. When the plants are in the ground I'll put some powder on the soil.

Well, I don't care if I share with other people, but I'm not good at housework. Maybe a home stay would be OK, but I don't like young children, because they're noisy and it's difficult to study. Hopefully, I can live with a lady who has retired. OK, that's no problem. But I must warn you that living with a family in London is very expensive. Much more expensive than other small cities.

Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time. Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music? That seems to be the case. That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell? Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports. Then I know I am going to fly somewhere exciting. But it's the general smell of my garden in the rain that I really like the most. That means I am at home where I should be. ",

Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time. Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music? That seems to be the case. That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell? Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports. Then I know I am going to fly somewhere exciting. But it's the general smell of my garden in the rain that I really like the most. That means I am at home where I should be. ",

It's very convenient and saves a lot of time. Now I just want to buy some clothes there. Wait a minute please. I'd like to recommend some better stores for man's clothes. Look, there, next to the bank, is a man's clothing store building. And there are also some good stores on Park Street. Are they far from here? No, it's just three blocks straight ahead. Ok, maybe I can shop around by myself. Thanks a lot for your help. That's my pleasure. Go ahead. ",
