Are there a lot of hills on the way? Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that? Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition. That sounds good. And you are right. For the kind of ride you are going to be doing, the most important thing is comfort. You want to make sure it's the right height for you? Follow me and I'll show you what we've got. ",

No, there's plenty of room, but I have to take the starter course before I can take Professor Miller's Shakespeare course. It is only offered in the evening. You don't like evening classes? That's not the point. I work in the cafe every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition. You can ask someone that could switch hours with you. Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day. That's a great idea. I'm free this afternoon. I'll go over and check it out. Their courses are actually cheaper. Thanks for your advice. I'll let you know what happens. Sure.

What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. I see. How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?

First of all, do you own a personal computer? Of course! Doesn't everyone? How long have you owned it? I bought this particular computer last year. But I got my first PC in 1995. I see. And what do you primarily use your computer for? Well, I use it to send e-mails a lot, and... um, I have a teach-yourself French program. And I shop online pretty often. Mmm. Any other uses? Keeping track of my bank account, and there are a couple of computer games I enjoy. Now you've mentioned e-mail and online shopping. Do you use the Internet for any other purposes? Not really. I haven't got around to explore it too much. Okay, thanks. Sorry to have given you so much trouble. Thanks again. ",

He wanted to know if we'd done them together. I said no. What's yours on? It took me ages to do mine. Well, I was really lucky. I found this book all about the population in New Zealand cities. Is it good? Yes, it's a great book! I photocopied three chapters. There are some brilliant charts and... What are you going to do with all that? Well, now I'm going to copy these pages and these charts and then I'll finish my project! You're not supposed to just copy the book. Oh! I think Mr. Harper won't know. He will know! He asked us to write a list of all the books we'd used. Remember? That's not the point anyway. What is the point then? Well, the point is that you're supposed to write your own project--you can't copy someone else's writing. Er... er... Well, you're right. Thank you for your reminding me of that. ",

I suppose I should look for a bigger house. But I don't see how I can afford one right now. If only you hadn't spent so much money on your vacation! You're right. But I really had a happy vacation. OK, Maybe you can move into Kelly's house and share that with her for a couple of months. Thank you. But I don't want to bother you too much. No trouble at all. How much should I pay for the rent? About 400 yuan a month. Great. That's one-third less than it was when I first rented a house. ",

The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

It's a youth culture marketing and trend forecasting firm in Hollywood. I'm one of Look-Look's 65,000 trendspotters worldwide. Look-Look gets a lot of information about the ever-shifting tastes of the youth market by these images. Yes, its clients are mostly companies. They get information about trends from Look-Look and develop their products. They also use the images of Look-Look on their websites to impress young people and promote their newly designed products. But are there any people who don't like their pictures to be used on the website? I always have my subjects' permission before I take their pictures and put up their images onto Look-Look.com. Where do you find your best subjects? At school, in the park, at local supermarkets and near many music clubs. What is difficult about this job? To catch our original styles because so many young people try hard to stand out. You have to be able to find the difference between someone who is copying trends and someone who is truly inventing a new look. Thank you for talk with us, Emily. ",

Oh, it's not like that. We're a small nonprofit organization, and we're hoping to save our local papers and all the jobs they create. Oh, that's an awesome cause! Fire away! Great. So, tell me what you like about newspapers. Well, there is a certain feel to holding a paper and turning the pages. The touch and sound of the paper as I fold it are so pleasant... A tablet can't give you this kind of feeling at all. Do you usually read the whole paper or go through different sections to pick out your favorite articles? I like being able to look around and find what I want. I can do this very quickly with a newspaper, but online news is tough for me to sort through. It takes me forever just to find something good, and sometimes when I do, it turns out to be something different! Do you dislike anything about your newspaper? Well, the only thing I can think of is all the ads nowadays. But it's even worse online, so I guess the answer is no! ",

There are so many things to see in the park. It has several main sections. They are named Main Street, Frontier Land, Fantasy Land, Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land. The park is often called a \"Magic Kingdom\". It must be an unforgettable experience for you. That's true, especially the Magic Mountain and Fantasy Land. I'm sure you'll enjoy your visit too. Thank you. I believe so. ",

Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage. ",

Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into. I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you. Thank you, madam.

And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into. I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you. Thank you, madam.

After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life. I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding. ",

But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life. I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding. ",

I left everything, you remember, to my wife, and, after her death, to my son Jerry. I've about $ 15 000 in shares of industrial companies. These bring in, after paying tax, about $ 1 125 a year. Well, I'm earning a good salary now, and I shall get a good pension from my employers, so my wife and I can live fairly comfortably with this extra income. I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him. Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house. Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect. Have you found a plot yet? Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me. I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land. You're not allowed to build a house without permission from the Planning Authority. And sometimes the Authority decides that a house must be built of stone, and not of brick, so that it doesn't spoil the surrounding village. ",

And most people rent a motor bike because you can get around faster and even go to the beach if you like. If I wanted to hire 2 motor bikes tomorrow morning for 2 days, would there be any problem? No problem at all. May I know your name? It's Green, G-R-E-E-N. And your telephone number? I'm at the Holiday Sun Hotel. My number is 0708112, I'm in Room 1203.

It has lovely views, and one of the most beautiful bridges in the world - the Golden Gate Bridge. It's a very hilly city. The hills are in the middle of the town, so you have to walk up and down hills when you go anywhere. When you arrive, your car needs good brakes. Do you have to drive? Can't you take buses? Well, most people who visit San Francisco ride in the cable cars. A cable car goes on tracks, and a strong cable pulls it up the hills. That doesn't sound very safe. Don't worry. Hundreds of people ride in cable cars every day. ",

April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok. ",

No, he didn't hurt me, but he took my handbag. Then what happened? What did you do? I caught hold of his knife, and he pushed me to the floor. Oh, no! Why did you catch hold of his knife?
