I just got back from Africa where I had a terrible accident in a motorcycle race. I broke both my legs when my motor failed and was hit by another motorcycle. I was laid up in a hospital over there for three weeks. Three weeks, that's a long time. What did you do while you were in the hospital? Well, if you can believe it, I read all about motorcycle racing. I love racing even if it hurts. But I'm afraid you don't make it look very funny. You're lucky to be alive. That's for sure.

14594,"We've all heard the saying ""Laughter is the best medicine."" How important is it to our health, Dr. Berk? This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.

Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right.

April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week.

Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30.
