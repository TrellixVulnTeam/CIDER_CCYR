I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?

Yeah, you're right. Could you tell me something about your plans for the future? To tell you the truth, I'm going to give up swimming from now on. I beg your pardon? I mean I'd rather not swim at all. I'm too old to... Excuse me, if I'm not wrong, you've only twenty now. Is it too old at twenty? Yes, too old for a swimmer. If I swim in an international competition, I'll hardly be able to win. But...er...don't you enjoy swimming? Certainly, and I enjoy visiting other countries, and the Olympics are very exciting.

No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.

I'm afraid I can't give you any of them at the moment. They've all been checked out. You're joking, all of them? Every month. I've asked professor Grand twice already to bring in additional copies of the articles, but no sooner do I place them on the shelves than they are gone. See that girl in the black sweater? She's been waiting for half an hour for those same articles to be returned. And here's me. I went out of my way to free out the whole afternoon to read.

You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment. Such as...? There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.

Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.

Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity.

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct.

The other senses seem to be more concrete somehow, but smell is so personal. I found it extremely interesting. Do you have any interesting information to give us about smells? Well, let's see.

45235,"Good morning, Mr. Tim. It's a long time since I had the pleasure of a visit from you. Yes, it must be three or four years. I haven't visited you since I called about my will. You helped me with that, you remember? Yes, I remember. Do you want to make any changes in your will? I don't think that will be necessary, but you'll tell me if it is. I left everything, you remember, to my wife, and, after her death, to my son Jerry. I've about $ 15 000 in shares of industrial companies. These bring in, after paying tax, about $ 1 125 a year. Well, I'm earning a good salary now, and I shall get a good pension from my employers, so my wife and I can live fairly comfortably with this extra income. I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him. Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house. Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect. Have you found a plot yet? Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too.

By the way, what time does the first class begin? At 8 o'clock. But before that we have 10 minutes to hand in homework and then 20 minutes for morning reading. So we must get to school before 7:30, right? Right. How long does each class last? 45 minutes, I think, with a 10 or 15 minutes' break. Well, I hear that lunchtime is nearly 12 o'clock and I'll be starving by then. Don't worry. During the break after the second class, we can buy something to eat.

Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right.

We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok.",catering [SEP] catering,NULL
