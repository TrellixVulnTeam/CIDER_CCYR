17211,"Hi, Jenny. Is it true you're moving to London? Yes, it is. What made you decide to do that? Work, mainly. I'm sure I'll be able to find a job there. You're probably right. But where are you going to live? I hope I'll find a flat to share with somebody. That way it will be cheaper. Yes, that's a good idea. Are you taking your dog with you? No, I don't think so. My parents have offered to take care of him, and I don't think he'd be happy in the city. You're probably right. But aren't you afraid of moving to such a big place, especially after living in a small village? Not really. I think I'll enjoy myself. There's so much to do there; I expect I won't miss the countryside much and I can always come back and visit. Well, I just hope you'll invite me to stay when you get settled.

20792,"Did you hear about the air crash that occurred in South America recently? It was quite a tragic accident! No, I didn't see anything in the news about it. What happened?

No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.

20893,"Tom, as the manager of a company selling green products, you are now quite a successful businessman. When did you know you wanted to have your own company? My family left Budapest in 1986 and settled in Canada where a lot of my friends' parents were highly successful businessmen. It seems so cool, so in high school, I started a web-designed company and learned a lot from that experience. How did you find the money for your present company then? We've raised 18 million dollars from about 50 people. We're finally making money. I own 6% of the company and all employees get their shares. By the way, what aspects of your life are green? I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada. Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful? We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design. They make the products then.",huge biker [SEP] green,implies

But I see the machines turned out here are quite modem and efficient. Following the national policy of self - reliance and hard - working struggle, we've tried our best in the past few years to improve our equipment. However, there is still a lot more to do. Now the question about yourself. I hope you don't mind it. How much do you earn each month? My monthly wage is 3,500 RMB, not including the extra pay of about 500 for extra work I put in.

21363,"Good evening and welcome to this week's Business World, the program for and about business people. Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business.",hire employee [SEP] money,NULL

I want to go to Columbia University in New York, but it's so expensive. It's also very far from where my family lives. I also would like to go to Northwestern University, but none of my friends from high school are going there. You'll make new friends when you go to college. I'm worried about making new friends. Also, I'm worried that I won't be smart enough to get good grades at a difficult college. I could go to the University of California, but I don't think they have a good teaching school. Most importantly, I want to go to a school that is famous for teaching. Those are all excellent schools, James. If you're accepted into all those schools, you should consider yourself very fortunate.

As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously.

Yes, that's no problem though I am not in charge of it. I'll ask someone to arrange it for you. What kind of place were you considering? Well, I don't care if I share with other people, but I'm not good at housework. Maybe a home stay would be OK, but I don't like young children, because they're noisy and it's difficult to study. Hopefully, I can live with a lady who has retired. OK, that's no problem. But I must warn you that living with a family in London is very expensive. Much more expensive than other small cities. That's not a big problem. I have some money saved. Besides, I can always get a part-time job. I'm working in a supermarket as a cashier now. So I don't think I will have trouble with money.
