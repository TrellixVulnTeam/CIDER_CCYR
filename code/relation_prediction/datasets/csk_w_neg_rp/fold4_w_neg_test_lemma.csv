Has anything happened to her? Nothing, it's just that she submitted a job application yesterday and the company asked her in for an interview today. She's afraid she won't be able to attend your class this afternoon. I'm calling to see whether it would be OK if I gave you her essay. Certainly, that would be fine. Uh, you can either drop it off at my class or bring it to my office. Would it be all right to come by your office around 4:00? I'm afraid I can't come any earlier because I have three classes this afternoon. Uh, I won't be here when you come. I'm supposed to be at a meeting from 3:00 to 6:00, but how about leaving it with my secretary? She usually stays until 5:00. Fine, please tell her I'll be there at 4:00.

Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business.",hire employee [SEP] get business loan,NULL
