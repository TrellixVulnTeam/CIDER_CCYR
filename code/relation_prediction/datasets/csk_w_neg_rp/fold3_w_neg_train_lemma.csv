Some friends of my parents' live out there and they invited me for as long as I wanted to stay. So what are you doing back here already? Oh, I have a paper to work on, and I just couldn't do any serious studying at the beach. I don't blame you. So what did you do out there? I mean besides lying out in the sun. I ran slowly up and down the beach, and 1 played some volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't even get through a whole game before I had to sit down. Did you go swimming? I wanted to, but they said the water isn't warm enough for that until a couple of months from now. It all sounds nice.

He's here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one ot the word's wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report? You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment. Such as...? There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

It usually has articles and stories about current affairs about science, as well as papers about new developments in research, I'm reading about a new telephone that allows you to see the person you are speaking to, as well as hear him. Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one? No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving. Oh, that's interesting. You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you? Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs? Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds. Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think? Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation.

Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam.

As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously.

I wondered if you could do some catering for us next week, we are having a small reception. It's to launch our summer holiday advertising campaign. Will you be free? When exactly is it? Mr. Smith? April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok.",light lunch [SEP] April 21st,NULL
