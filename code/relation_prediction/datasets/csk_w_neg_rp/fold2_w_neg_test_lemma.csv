52932,"Hi, Kevin. How is it going? Ah, not so great. What's wrong? I've got a big problem with the Shakespeare course which is required for my major. Is that all filled up? No, there's plenty of room, but I have to take the starter course before I can take Professor Miller's Shakespeare course. It is only offered in the evening. You don't like evening classes? That's not the point. I work in the cafe every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition. You can ask someone that could switch hours with you. Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day.

This one is special because of its color, and the images moving. Oh, that's interesting. You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan.
