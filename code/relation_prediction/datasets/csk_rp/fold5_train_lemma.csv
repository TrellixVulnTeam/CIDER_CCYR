I get out of my car here this time every day. You seem to be nervous about your lessons. Have you finished your review? I've only been studying night and day for the last week. If I don't get an A in this class, I won't get the support of my country. This class is really just a review for me. I've been learning it for two years. That's lucky for you. Jeanie, can you guess what the test will be like? Will it be difficult? I hope not. But I'm still worried about it. Well, cheer up. Hope for good luck.

No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly. What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure? Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers. Weren't they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language? Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction. How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident? The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That's a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet. So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions. Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.

He's here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one ot the word's wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report? You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment. Such as...? There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

I'm going to teach English to some immigrants in the university's community service program. That sounds interesting. Don't you need to speak a foreign language for a job like that? No, you don't. You just have to present the language simply and give the students a chance to practice speaking. Come to think of it, that's the way I was taught to speak Chinese. But speaking didn't help me learn to read and write Chinese. My students won't want to read and write English, at lease not now. They are more interested in speaking.

Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.

Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American.

20715,"With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. Hello, everyone. We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?

20774,"Dr Smith, you were a political journalist in America and I was told that you've chosen to live here, a mountain village like this in the Himalayan Community. Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here? Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me.

The other senses seem to be more concrete somehow, but smell is so personal. I found it extremely interesting. Do you have any interesting information to give us about smells? Well, let's see. Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time. Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music? That seems to be the case. That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell? Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports.

I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him. Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house. Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect. Have you found a plot yet? Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me. I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land.

Well, I'm earning a good salary now, and I shall get a good pension from my employers, so my wife and I can live fairly comfortably with this extra income. I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him. Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house. Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect. Have you found a plot yet? Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me. I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land.
