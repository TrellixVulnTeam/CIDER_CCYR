1123,"Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . Don't forget to say "" Thank you "" when you take a seat . Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment . Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again .

If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me.

I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life. I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding.","village stay [SEP] poverty , dirt , ignorance",has property
