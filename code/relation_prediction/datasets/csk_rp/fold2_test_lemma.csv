21737,"Do you collect cola cans, Steve? No. Why do you ask? You have so many empty cans here. Well, my mum wants me to keep all the cans, so that we can sell them after a while. Aha, you are going to make a millionaire of yourself sooner or later with all those cans. You bet I will. Well, that's not the point. The point is we separate reusable things from other rubbish. We have to pay the dustman for dealing with rubbish, but if we sell him these cans and other reusable material we pay less. That sounds a clever idea. Now what are reused in China? Metal, plastic, paper, books and the like. Just as we do back home in the States. And to avoid waste, the government is limiting the production of goods that can be used only once, such as bamboo chopsticks. For example, all the fast food boxes should be made of paper instead of non-reusable material. That will surely be helpful for a clean environment.",limit production good [SEP] clean environment,implies

Do you prefer part-time or full-time employment? Part-time. OK. Some people choose part-time jobs because they want to do something else besides work, such as reading novels or playing sports. But they will not get any other benefits besides the wages. I don't care about that. May I ask you if I can decide the hours I would work? I can only give you the choice from 7:00 a.m. till noon or from noon till 5:00 p.m. Then I'd prefer to work in the morning because I have to prepare dinner for my children. OK, Mrs. Sharp. Just sign your name on this sheet of paper. You may start next week. Mrs. Clarkson has got something ready for you--a blackboard, some chalk, and a tape recorder. She'll show you around later.

Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one? No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving. Oh, that's interesting. You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you? Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs? Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds. Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think? Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation. So maybe a lot of overseas travel can be avoided. Yes, I suppose so.",allow person speak [SEP] lot overseas travel avoid,causes

As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? Yes, madam.
