I think you should think of modern art like food. You need to taste things to see if you like them. You know, some of the pieces at the exhibition were even for sale. The last one was on sale for $9,000. $9,000? Well, I may go and visit the exhibition tomorrow, but I'm not going to buy anything. OK, let me know how it goes, won't you? And you might give Tom a call. He wanted to go with me today but his aunt was in town so he couldn't. He really wants to go. OK, I will. ",

No, there's plenty of room, but I have to take the starter course before I can take Professor Miller's Shakespeare course. It is only offered in the evening. You don't like evening classes? That's not the point. I work in the cafe every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition. You can ask someone that could switch hours with you. Maybe just switch a couple of evenings since the course probably only meets two times a week. I wish I could. My boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings. And he'll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Have you checked the course over at the community college? They might offer an introductory course during the day. That's a great idea. I'm free this afternoon. I'll go over and check it out. Their courses are actually cheaper. Thanks for your advice. I'll let you know what happens. Sure.

We've raised 18 million dollars from about 50 people. We're finally making money. I own 6% of the company and all employees get their shares. By the way, what aspects of your life are green? I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada. Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful? We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design. They make the products then. ",

They can decide when to open. Most are open for 3 or 4 hours at lunchtime and again from about 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. In busy areas, pubs may stay open from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Are there pubs in China? Yes. Most of the customers are young people. They like to hang out with their friends after work and have fun. It is against the law in England to go into a pub if you are under the age of l4.

It's for real scientists, or can ordinary people like me understand it? Oh, it's for anyone really. It usually has articles and stories about current affairs about science, as well as papers about new developments in research, I'm reading about a new telephone that allows you to see the person you are speaking to, as well as hear him. Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one? No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving. Oh, that's interesting. You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you? Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs? Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds. Hum.

It's a youth culture marketing and trend forecasting firm in Hollywood. I'm one of Look-Look's 65,000 trendspotters worldwide. Look-Look gets a lot of information about the ever-shifting tastes of the youth market by these images. Yes, its clients are mostly companies. They get information about trends from Look-Look and develop their products. They also use the images of Look-Look on their websites to impress young people and promote their newly designed products. But are there any people who don't like their pictures to be used on the website? I always have my subjects' permission before I take their pictures and put up their images onto Look-Look.com. Where do you find your best subjects? At school, in the park, at local supermarkets and near many music clubs. What is difficult about this job? To catch our original styles because so many young people try hard to stand out. You have to be able to find the difference between someone who is copying trends and someone who is truly inventing a new look. Thank you for talk with us, Emily. ",

However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? That's right. And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs.
