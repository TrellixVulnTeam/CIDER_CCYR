Do you know when it is going to start working again ? Give it a couple days , and it should be back on . Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working ? Since it's not working , I'm going to give you a credit . So I don't have to pay anything ? You won't pay anything until your cable starts working again . Okay , thank you very much for your help . No problem . Thank you for being so understanding . ",

Uh, you can either drop it off at my class or bring it to my office. Would it be all right to come by your office around 4:00? I'm afraid I can't come any earlier because I have three classes this afternoon. Uh, I won't be here when you come.

Are there a lot of hills on the way? Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that? Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition. That sounds good. And you are right.

Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that. Mostly I'll just be using it to get me back and forth from work. How far is that? About four miles. Are there a lot of hills on the way? Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that?

Do you get any regular exercise? I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too.

And what do you primarily use your computer for? Well, I use it to send e-mails a lot, and... um, I have a teach-yourself French program. And I shop online pretty often. Mmm. Any other uses? Keeping track of my bank account, and there are a couple of computer games I enjoy. Now you've mentioned e-mail and online shopping. Do you use the Internet for any other purposes? Not really.

Perhaps we could just give the party in the office and put up some balloons. That's great. I think we should also buy a really big card, a huge card, and we should get everybody to sign it.

A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. What needs to be done? Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. So you are hopeful for the future. As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren't wasted, as they were in the past. ",

Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \"Aaah\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed. What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh? Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference! ",

Yes, but I don't like horror films because they really give me nightmares. I don't like horror films either. They're sort of stupid and unbelievable. I do like crime films, you know, where you can follow the detective and try to guess who the murderer is. What about a comedy or musical? No, I'm not interested. What about ringing up the ABC and find out what's on? Then we can decide. OK. That's definitely the best thing we ought to do because I haven't got an evening paper. ",

I believe it's not too late to change your major because you've mainly taken general requirements which all freshmen have to take. Also we have twelve electives so the mo lit courses will be included in them, so you can change your major without losing any credit hours. I am very happy to know I am still able to change my major. I am interested in writing newspaper articles, and after finishing my degree I would like to work for some newspaper firm. Oh, I think you will be a good writer. Dr. Steven, when do students start practical training? They don't begin practical training in reporting until the sophomore year.

I watch a soccer match nearly every Saturday afternoon either at the local stadium or on TV. What about you, John?Do you play football? I'm afraid not. And I don't watch it either. I know it's Britain's most popular outdoor game, but I never liked it, not even when I was at school. But don't you watch the Cup finals and the great international matches between British teams and other national teams? Very rarely. My favourite game is cricket. I used to be quite a good cricket player when I was at school and I've kept it up ever since. It's a very English game, isn't it? Yes, it is. It has become popular in the Commonwealth countries. Do you ever watch the matches between England and the other Commonwealth countries?They're very interesting and exciting. Yes, I watch them on TV. ",

I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. You mean you don't keep regular hours? Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business. ",

I want to go to Columbia University in New York, but it's so expensive. It's also very far from where my family lives. I also would like to go to Northwestern University, but none of my friends from high school are going there. You'll make new friends when you go to college. I'm worried about making new friends. Also, I'm worried that I won't be smart enough to get good grades at a difficult college. I could go to the University of California, but I don't think they have a good teaching school. Most importantly, I want to go to a school that is famous for teaching. Those are all excellent schools, James. If you're accepted into all those schools, you should consider yourself very fortunate. When I went to school, I went to a very small college, and I still got a great job as principal. You will be successful because you work very hard. Thanks for your help, Principal Skinner. ",

We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

Yes, very hard. Sometimes, it's difficult to walk in the mountains where the air is very thin, and you have a lot of problems when breathing. What kind of equipment did you take? Not much. Only a bag, a sleeping bag and some warm clothing. We carried all the things by ourselves. And how was the food? There was rice and some vegetables, normally no meat. But it was good. What was the best thing about the trip? The walking and the exercise. I hate sitting in the sun and like to be out in the countryside. The air is very clean and it's very quiet.

Then he gets around them to make him a cup of tea, and while they are out of the room he steals their money, handbag whatever and makes off with it. But you know, Jane, it's partly their own fault. You should never let anyone like that in unless you're expecting them. It's all very well to say that. But someone comes to the door, and says electricity or gas and you automatically think they are OK, especially if they flash a card to you Does this man have an ID then? Yes, that's just it. It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time. According to the paper the police are warning people especially pensioners not to admit anyone unless they have an appointment. It's a bit sad. One old lady told them she'd just been to the post\u2013office to draw her pension when he called. She said he must have followed her home. He stole the whole lot.

Did you know that it's harder to forget smells than to forget facts? There have been experiments where people could pick out a particular smell thirty days after smelling it for the first time. Really? So smells can bring back more memories than, say, music? That seems to be the case. That's interesting. So what's your favorite smell? Oh, I have lots of different ones. The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports.

I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of problems? Well, we haven't had any hot water for a couple of days now. I wonder if you could send someone to have a look at it. Of course. I'll get someone to come around at the weekend. Well, could he come around a bit sooner? I don't think we can manage until the weekend. I see. Okay. I'll send someone over this afternoon then. There's also the matter of the fridge. We all assumed there would be one in the flat when we moved in, because that's what we read from the advertisement in the newspaper. Ah, yes. Sorry about that. I got rid of the old fridge, but I didn't get around to ordering a new one yet. I'm really sorry. I'll order one today and get it delivered to you tomorrow. We bought one on the Internet actually. But could you pay us back? Of course. Just tell me how much you paid for it. It's 260 pounds. Thank you. ",

I left everything, you remember, to my wife, and, after her death, to my son Jerry. I've about $ 15 000 in shares of industrial companies. These bring in, after paying tax, about $ 1 125 a year. Well, I'm earning a good salary now, and I shall get a good pension from my employers, so my wife and I can live fairly comfortably with this extra income. I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him. Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house. Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect. Have you found a plot yet? Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me. I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land. You're not allowed to build a house without permission from the Planning Authority. And sometimes the Authority decides that a house must be built of stone, and not of brick, so that it doesn't spoil the surrounding village. ",

I understand how you're feeling. Just take it easy. You'll make a lot of friends very soon. Thank you. I'll try my best to get used to my new school life as soon as possible. By the way, what time does the first class begin? At 8 o'clock. But before that we have 10 minutes to hand in homework and then 20 minutes for morning reading. So we must get to school before 7:30, right? Right. How long does each class last? 45 minutes, I think, with a 10 or 15 minutes' break. Well, I hear that lunchtime is nearly 12 o'clock and I'll be starving by then. Don't worry. During the break after the second class, we can buy something to eat. That's good. ",

April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right.

No, he didn't hurt me, but he took my handbag. Then what happened? What did you do? I caught hold of his knife, and he pushed me to the floor. Oh, no! Why did you catch hold of his knife?

What is the largest building on the left? That's Honor Department Store. They sell clothing, furniture, food-almost everything. Do you like purchasing everything in the supermarket? It's very convenient and saves a lot of time. Now I just want to buy some clothes there. Wait a minute please. I'd like to recommend some better stores for man's clothes. Look, there, next to the bank, is a man's clothing store building. And there are also some good stores on Park Street. Are they far from here? No, it's just three blocks straight ahead. Ok, maybe I can shop around by myself. Thanks a lot for your help. That's my pleasure. Go ahead. ",
