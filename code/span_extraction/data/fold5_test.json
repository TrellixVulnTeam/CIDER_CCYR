And what do you primarily use your computer for? Well, I use it to send e-mails a lot, and... um, I have a teach-yourself French program. And I shop online pretty often. Mmm. Any other uses? Keeping track of my bank account, and there are a couple of computer games I enjoy. Now you've mentioned e-mail and online shopping. Do you use the Internet for any other purposes? Not really.

I can't do that any more because it's not good for the public to see that. It's not good for me. Your father said you have the ability to be one of the biggest influences in history, not just golf, humanity. What do you think of that? I think that is more important than just my golf. I think my golf is merely a vehicle to influence people How? How? Oh, so many kids look up to role models, so I can help out kids in a positive way, I can influence their lives in a positive way, and I think that's what it's about. I mean you are only 21, what's the goal? Where do you go? Keep winning. But you know, at a certain point, doesn't lose its thing...? Winning never gets old and having fun never gets old either. And you always have fun. And playing these tournaments is with all the apprehension and everything, still fun? Always. The day it's not fun is the day I quit And it's been fan since I was in the high chair. And it's fun today. ",

A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \"Aaah\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed. What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh? Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference! ",

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do.

Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. You look as if you've lost weight as well. I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure. ",

Robin, can you tell us what the mountain lake cycle tour is all about? Well, Ann, the tour today is not a race. People do it for fitness and fun andtry to better their time every year. How long will it take to cycle one way, Robin? About seven to nine hours for the average cyclists. Good cyclists can do it in four hours. How many people will be taking part this year? This is our biggest year ever. We have twelve hundred cyclists registered. I doubt they'll block the road when the cyclists start out? Don't worry, we've introduced the staggered starts to avoid these problems. Our first group will leave Ottawa at seven o'clock. Thank you, Robin. Now down to the starting line of the university. ",

I wondered if you could do some catering for us next week, we are having a small reception. It's to launch our summer holiday advertising campaign. Will you be free? When exactly is it? Mr. Smith? April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday. Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it? We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there. Ok. What sort of things would you like? Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again. Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for? Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure. Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week. Ok. ",
